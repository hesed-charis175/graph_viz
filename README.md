### Graph Visualizer

## New Features:

-  *Grids*: Will soon be measured. Will Probably add a meter rule which is dynamic. The user can set it to 1 pixel => 1m and so forth.
-  *Panel Refined into tabs*: The appearance editor in the panel in linux_comp_docking branch was refined to fit in a tab.
-  *Nodes Debug List*: The node debug list now enables node selection
-  *Edges*: We can add an edge in between two nodes by right-click dragging from one to another. When dragging the edge is snapped to closest node from the cursor when close enough.
-  *Node Deletion*: The Node editor now has a new button to delete the node. Deleting the node deletes the edges associated to it.
-  *Consistent node id*: The node ids were made more consistent
-  *Multi selection enabled*: Multiple nodes can now be selected by holding <Ctrl> and clicking on them. it opens a multi selection node, that enables to reset the node types.
-  *Selecting all nodes*: When clicking <A>, all nodes are selected and the multi selection node popup is enabled. Pressing <Esc> leaves the selection.
-  *Logging on separate thread*: Logging and `DebugLogs` content is handled by another thread.
